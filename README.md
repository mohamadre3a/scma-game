# SCMA Morning Dash 🎮🚚

An interactive **classroom logistics game** built for **SCMA 455 – Logistics Management** at the University of Calgary.  
It helps students wake up in morning lectures and learn key logistics concepts by competing on shortest-path, TSP, VRP, and order-picking puzzles.  

---

## ✨ Features
- Instructor dashboard to start/close rounds.
- Multiple game modes:
  - **Shortest Path (SP)** with single/dual objectives.
  - **Traveling Salesperson (TSP)**.
  - **Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP)** with capacity constraints.
  - **Warehouse Order-Picking** with Manhattan distance.
- Leaderboard with cumulative season points:
  - `points = 20 – placement` (e.g., 1st = 19 pts).
- Student login via **username + PIN** (from CSV roster).
- Persistent data storage with **Supabase** (does not reset on redeploy).
- Export round/season results to CSV.

   git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/scma-dash.git
   cd scma-dash
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Create `.env.local`:
   ```env
   VITE_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_url
   VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_supabase_key
   ```

4. Run dev server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
   Open [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173).

## 🌐 Deployment (Free)

We recommend **Vercel (frontend)** + **Supabase (backend database)**.

1. Push your repo to GitHub.
2. Create a project in [Supabase](https://supabase.com).
3. Run the provided SQL (see `docs/schema.sql`) to create tables:
   - `roster` (student logins)
   - `rounds`
   - `submissions`
   - `season_totals`
4. Import your **username+PIN CSV** into the `roster` table.
5. On Vercel:
   - Import your GitHub repo.
   - Framework: **Vite**.
   - Build: `npm run build`.
   - Output: `dist/`.
   - Add environment variables from `.env.local`.

Custom domain? Point `scma.shahsahebi.com` (CNAME) → Vercel.

## 🎲 Game Modes Explained

### 1) Shortest Path (SP)
- **Goal:** Reach **T** from **S**.
- **Objectives:**
  - Minimize **time**, **cost**, or **CO₂**.
  - Or dual-objective: `α·A + (1–α)·B`.
- **Rules:** Click nodes along valid edges only. Submit at **T** before time runs out.

---

### 2) Traveling Salesperson (TSP)
- **Goal:** Start at **S**, visit every node exactly once, and return to **S**.
- **Distances:** Euclidean.
- **Hints:** App shows dashed lines from your current node to all unvisited nodes with distances.
- **Rules:** Submit only when tour is complete.

---

### 3) Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP)
- **Goal:** Serve all customers with **vehicle capacity Q**.
- **Demands:** Shown beside each customer as `d:x`.
- **Rules:**
  - Click customers in sequence.
  - Click **S** to return/reset load.
  - App auto-splits routes if load would exceed Q.
- **Status:** Panel shows **current load** and per-leg distances.

---

### 4) Warehouse Order-Picking
- **Goal:** Start at **S (dock)**, visit all pick locations, and return to **S**.
- **Distance metric:** Manhattan (grid/aisles, no diagonals).
- **Panel:** Shows step-by-step walking distance.

---

## 🏆 Scoring

- **Round Score:** based on solution quality vs optimal/baseline + speed bonus.
- **Season Points:**  
  - Placement → `20 – rank`.  
  - Example: 1st = 19 pts, 5th = 15 pts, ≥20th = 0.
- Non-submitters get **0**.

## 📊 Instructor Workflow

1. Log in with instructor PIN.
2. Open a round (choose mode, nodes, timer).
3. Students log in (username + PIN).
4. When time ends → close round → reveal leaderboard.
5. Export results if needed.
6. Season totals update automatically.
